Software Engineering student ZethBox.

I have a wide range of interests from web development to video games, I hope to learn as much as I can from many subjects.

My main interest is in backend services and software design.

I code mostly on Java, but also have a bit of experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, C#, Python, and C. I aspire to deepen my knowledge on these languages and be able to implement fully functional pieces of software in the near future.
